# Part 3: Dashboards and plotting in Grafana

Some of the figures we just generated are fine, or might be useful for a publication, but say we are routinely collecting and downloading data and we want to track our data as it is coming in (maybe we are routinely collecting data and want a quick / dynamic way to visualize). We can leverage our same SQL databases into the open-source Grafana dashboarding tool. Let's check it out!

## Create a read-only user in MySQL to interface with Grafana

There's no reason Grafana needs to be able to write new data, it's just visualizing what we already collected, so let's make a restricted version.

> CREATE USER 'grafana-demo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'aaartutorial';

> SELECT User from mysql.user;

> GRANT SELECT ON database_name.table_name TO 'username'@'localhost';

> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Now let's hop on over to Grafana and see what we can do. In general this will consist of:

* Connecting to our MySQL data source (just a one time thing)
* Creating new panels for our dashboard either using SQL Query or with their interactive code builder.
